              This case study explores how MongoDB was utilized to support the Fair Bay City Bikes project, 
              an initiative proposed to address urban transportation challenges in Fair Bay City. 
          
              Fair Bay, a rapidly expanding city, faced issues such as crowded public transport, rising fuel prices, 
              traffic congestion, and poor air quality. To tackle these concerns, the Fair Bay City Council 
              encouraged innovative solutions, leading to the development of Fair Bay City Bikesâ€”an eco-friendly, 
              cost-effective bike-sharing platform.
          
              The project required a robust, scalable, and cost-effective IT infrastructure, and MongoDB was chosen 
              as the database solution due to its flexible schema and JSON-based data structure. The implementation 
              involved designing key database entities such as users, vehicles, rides, and ride logs to ensure seamless 
              tracking and analytics.

              The major challenge was designing a database that could efficiently handle ride tracking,

              MongoDB's document-based approach allowed for flexible schema design and scalability, 
              addressing these challenges effectively.
